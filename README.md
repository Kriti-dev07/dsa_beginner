# DSA for Mere Mortals 😅

Welcome to my **messy-but-learning DSA repo**! If you’re like me — a total beginner trying to make sense of arrays, loops, and recursion without losing your sanity — you’re in the right place.

## What’s inside
- Random problems I tried (sometimes succeeded 😬)
- Super basic stuff: Arrays, Strings, Loops, Recursion
- Solutions in C++(becuase thats all i know right now)
- Code with **lots of comments **

## Who should look here
- Absolute beginners like me
- People who want to see **real struggle → learning → small victories**
- Anyone who thinks “DSA sounds scary, but let’s try anyway”

## How to use it
1. Pick a problem
2. Read my messy attempt
3. Try to do it yourself before cheating (I mean… looking at my code 😅)
4. Laugh, cry, learn, repeat
